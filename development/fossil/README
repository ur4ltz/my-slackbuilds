Fossil is a distributed version control and ticket tracking system
created by D. Richard Hipp, the primary author of SQLite.

Features:

- tamper-proof artifact record
- simple command-line interface
- customizable web interface with JSON, RSS, and built-in wiki
- online project documentation with full-text search capability
- online activity and ticket reports
- user accounts with access controls
- coherent versioning across all files
- straightforward branching and merging
- bisect searches to pinpoint behavior changes
- SHA3-256 and hardened SHA1 checksums
- FUSE filesystem makes all historical and branch revisions available
- synchronization via http, https, ssh, and local/network filesystems
- automated replication and backup
- git import/export and Subversion/CVS import
- nested checkouts to share common subtrees across related projects
- checkout directory not cluttered with administrative files
- support for Docker

Fossil can host the entire project development website, including the
download area, but it also can be used for individual projects with no
need for a shared server.

In addition to typical software development operations, one interesting
application is coordination and auditing of /etc and other configuration
files across a network of computers.

Content is stored in an SQLite database for atomicity, durability, and
effortless administration.
